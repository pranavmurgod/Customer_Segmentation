# Customer_Segmentation

This project demonstrates the application of K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation using a dataset of mall customers. By analyzing customer spending habits, annual income, and demographics, we identify key clusters to enhance targeted marketing strategies.

## Project Overview
Customer segmentation is critical for understanding diverse customer groups and tailoring business strategies to meet unique needs. In this project, we apply clustering algorithms to a dataset containing customer profiles to discover actionable insights. The main focus is on identifying the optimal number of clusters using the KMeans algorithm and exploring customer segments through univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

## Project Goals
1. Data Preparation & Cleaning:
Handle missing values, correct data types, and create summary statistics.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess trends in features like age, annual income, and spending scores.
Univariate and Bivariate Analysis:

2. Analyze individual variables (age, income, spending score) using KDE and box plots to identify patterns.
Explore relationships between variables to discover significant customer behaviors.
K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation:

3. Apply scaling and encode categorical variables as necessary.
Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Perform clustering and visualize results to clearly define customer groups.

## Results and Insights:
Interpret clusters to reveal distinct customer segments, valuable for strategic decision-making.
Provide recommendations for targeted marketing based on customer profiles.

## Key Features
1. Elbow Method & Silhouette Score: Evaluated the optimal number of clusters for precise customer segmentation.
2. Data Visualizations: Created clear scatter plots and cluster visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
3. Cluster Interpretation: Detailed examination of cluster centroids to define unique customer types.
4. New Data Predictions: Enabled clustering of new customer data to predict segment fit and tailor offerings.

## Technologies Used
Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Dataset
The project uses the Mall Customers Dataset, featuring attributes such as customer age, gender, annual income, and spending score. Basic data cleaning and preparation steps are applied to ensure a robust analysis.

## Workflow Summary:
1. Data Loading and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Implementing KMeans Clustering
4. Visualization of clusters and centroids

## Key Insights and Outcomes
1. Distinct Customer Segments: Identified segments with unique spending patterns, helping to prioritize marketing efforts.
2. Strategic Marketing Recommendations: Suggested targeted campaigns for high-value and growth potential segments.
3. Model Performance: Used silhouette scores to validate clustering quality, ensuring reliable customer grouping.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of K-Means Clustering for data-driven customer segmentation. By examining spending behavior and demographics, it reveals valuable insights to support targeted marketing, thereby enhancing business growth and efficiency.
